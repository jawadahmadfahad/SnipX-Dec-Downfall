1
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:24,140
I am convinced that you will find only one answer everywhere.

2
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:33,960
Do not speak of guests and do not speak of symbolic trade, but rather of peace.

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,979
That is the wish of the people.

4
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:46,179
If this Sunday speaks to me of this great trust of the German people,

5
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,659
and legitimizes me again as the speaker of the nation,

6
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,780
and with that I am justified to say what I am explaining here,

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,880
that Germany is explaining, that the German people is explaining.

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,280
We have become such a decent people again.

9
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,239
We have become such a hardworking and capable people again.

10
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,959
What can we not do again in Germany?

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,980
What do we not have for tasks?

12
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:23,819
We have been told all these years that the German people are not quite equal to the other peoples in the world.

13
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,519
What do we have for tasks today?

14
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,859
What great works are we building?

15
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:31,840
We are building the most beautiful streets today,

16
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,340
huge facilities, industrial art, new inventions we have made,

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,439
enormous residential colonies.

18
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,579
They are being created and have already been created.

19
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,239
What is not being worked on everywhere, in all areas?

20
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:52,620
We have proven in these three years that we are a people that can stand up to others.

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,340
And that is why I am asking you, German people,

22
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,120
to give your verdict.

23
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,659
I do not submit to the world.

24
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,739
It cannot judge me.

25
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,340
I submit to you.

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,140
Do you judge me?

27
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,159
Do you give me a confession if you think my work is right?

28
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,719
Do you think that I have been hardworking, that I have worked,

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,099
that I have not used myself for you in these years,

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,159
that I have used my time well in the service of my people?

31
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,300
Do you give me a vote now?

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,340
If yes, then step in for me as I step in for you.
